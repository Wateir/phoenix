# Phoenix
A small tool written in C to retrieve your Linux installation date

## Usage
### Classic
```
❯ phoenix
10 days, 1 hours and 18 minutes
```
#### Long option
You can use the `--long` option to display all values, even when they are 0.
```
❯ phoenix --long
0 years, 0 months, 10 days, 1 hours and 21 minutes
```

### Only one unit
Phoenix also offers the `--unique <unit>` option for displaying a single value. The option is therefore incompatible with `--long`.

It must be accompanied by a value; the available values are :
- `years` / `y`
- `months` / `m`
- `days` / `d`
- `hours` / `h`
- `minutes` / `min`

```
❯ phoenix --unique hours
241 hours

❯ phoenix --unique days
10 days
```

### Translation
You can use a translated version of phoenix (currently only available in French).

The translation is available with the `--lang <lang>` option. This is compatible with both classic and only one unit modes.

```
❯ phoenix --lang fr
10 jours, 1 heures et 33 minutes

❯ phoenix --lang fr --unique hours
241 heures
```
